        "Alt + Shift" and highlight the paragraph and it will multi highlight each line.

- Lorem is part of VSCode. Lorem20 will give 20 random words in one sentence.

- [Emmet Cheat Sheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)
    
    Emmet is part of VSCode. Used when no content is in place.
    
    "! + enter" will give html5 template.

    Some Emmet concepts that use same syntax as CSS:

        + is the sibling selector ex. nav+ul+li gives them as siblings.
  
        > is the child selector ex. nav>ul>>li*6 gives them as children of the previous.

        ^ is the move up action.

        . class

        # id

    Use "Ctrl + Space" to get Emmet back in play.
