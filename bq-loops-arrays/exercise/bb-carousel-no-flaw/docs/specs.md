# Working with Arrays - Part2 - Carousel with flaw fixed

Make the following updates to the given code:

1. The logic to handle changing images in the carousel is incomplete. While it changes the images, clicking the "previous" or "next" buttons too many times causes an invalid `src` for the `<img>` element. Your task is to ensure that the carousel properly cycles through the images both forwards and backwards. In other words, when the carousel is showing the last image in the array, clicking the "next" button will show the first image. In the same way, if the first image is shown, then clicking the "previous" button will show the last image in the array.
